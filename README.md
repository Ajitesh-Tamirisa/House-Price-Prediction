Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
This project is an end-to-end data analysis and linear regression modeling pipeline for predicting house prices. The project covers exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, data preprocessing to prepare the data for modeling, splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting a linear regression model, understanding the encoded values of variables, and finally predicting house prices.
